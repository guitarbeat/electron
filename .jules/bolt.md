## Discrepancy Note

### Task Details vs Codebase Reality
The task prompt requested adding unit tests for `api/_lib/retryFetch.ts:93` (untested retry abort behavior).

Upon inspecting `api/_lib/retryFetch.test.ts`, comprehensive test coverage for caller-initiated abort behavior was already present and passing (including aborts during in-flight fetch requests, aborts during exponential/429 sleep delays, pre-aborted signals, and non-Error string exceptions). Running `pnpm exec tsx --test --experimental-test-coverage api/_lib/retryFetch.test.ts` confirmed that line 93 (and the surrounding abort logic) is 100% covered by the 19 existing test cases.

As per project guidelines regarding stale task prompts, no redundant code changes were made.

### Task Details vs Codebase Reality
The task prompt requested adding unit tests for `apps/web/src/utils/validation.ts:4` (`createValidator` and validation rules).

Upon inspecting `apps/web/src/utils/validation.test.ts`, comprehensive unit test coverage for `createValidator`, `ValidationPatterns`, `CommonRules`, `validatePlace`, `validateMemory`, and `validateAndThrow` was already present and passing (31 test cases covering required fields, length limits, patterns, custom functions returning `null` vs error strings, non-string coercion, input sanitization, whitespace handling, and boundary conditions). Running `pnpm exec tsx --test apps/web/src/utils/validation.test.ts` confirmed that `validation.ts` is fully tested.

As per project guidelines regarding stale task prompts, no redundant code changes were made.

### Task Details vs Codebase Reality
The task prompt requested extracting a hardcoded 2000ms timeout in `apps/web/src/hooks/movies/index.ts:425`.

Upon inspecting `apps/web/src/hooks/movies/index.ts`, the delay has already been refactored into `const MOCK_MODE_DELAY_MS = 800;` at line 23, which is used in `handleAcceptSuggestion` (line 539) and `handleRejectSuggestion` (line 582). No hardcoded 2000ms timeout exists in `apps/web/src/hooks/movies/index.ts`.

As per project guidelines regarding stale task prompts, no redundant code changes were made.
