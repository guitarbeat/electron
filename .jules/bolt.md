## Discrepancy Note

### Task Details vs Codebase Reality
The task prompt requested adding unit tests for `api/_lib/retryFetch.ts:93` (untested retry abort behavior).

Upon inspecting `api/_lib/retryFetch.test.ts`, comprehensive test coverage for caller-initiated abort behavior was already present and passing (including aborts during in-flight fetch requests, aborts during exponential/429 sleep delays, pre-aborted signals, and non-Error string exceptions). Running `pnpm exec tsx --test --experimental-test-coverage api/_lib/retryFetch.test.ts` confirmed that line 93 (and the surrounding abort logic) is 100% covered by the 19 existing test cases.

As per project guidelines regarding stale task prompts, no redundant code changes were made.
